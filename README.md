This project takes a title name from the user and tries to search for this on Wikipedia. Once it has found the title or something similar to it, it then parses the data into Json format and is sorted to be displayed by who has editied the page and at what time each change was made. 

Issues:

- Some words when entered will crash the program. For example "Ball State" will work but "Ballstate" will crash
- You will have to reset the program each time you want to try a different word
